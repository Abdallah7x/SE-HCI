<b>Message From Principal</b>
</div>
<div class="principal">
Dear Students and Parents,
As Nelson Mandela once said: “Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the
world.'<br>
We at Sharm El Sheikh College find it our duty to nurture today's children as they are tomorrow's future. We
instil in our children the love of seeking knowledge and the belief that it is an ongoing, never-ending process.
We
them for the ever-changing world around us, encouraging them to become design thinkers and
prepare
entrepreneurs within the expanding global community of the 21st Century. We can achieve this by instilling
SSC's Personal Core Values within our daily school life, assisting them to face the unknown and be ready for
any unexpected circumstance. We also believe that fulfilling these goals should be a joint venture shared by
both the School and the Parents.<br>
Together, we can achieve the impossible and make it a reality.<br>
Together we can set the roots of knowledgeable, creative, intellectual and passionate individuals, who will
have positive and lasting impacts on their society and future world.<br>
Let's all follow the advice of Les Brown: “Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you’ll land among the stars."
School Principal<br><br>
Doris Hanna, MAED
